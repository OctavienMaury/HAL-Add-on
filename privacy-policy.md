Thank you for using the **Random HAL Article** browser extension. Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data while using our extension.

## Data Collection

We want to reassure you that **no personal information or data** is collected or stored by this extension. The extension does not track your activity, gather any personal data, or interact with your browsing behavior beyond its intended functionality.

## Usage of the HAL API

The extension simply queries the HAL (Hyper Articles en Ligne) API to fetch academic documents like articles and theses. These requests are anonymous and do not require any personal information from you.

- **Access to the HAL API**: This is necessary to retrieve the random articles, theses, or documents from HAL.

## Third-Party Services

This extension does not share any data with third parties. It only interacts with the HAL API to provide its core functionality. No data is shared with other services, and no third-party tracking is involved.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update this privacy policy as necessary. However, we will always ensure that your privacy and data security remain a top priority, and any changes will be reflected here.
